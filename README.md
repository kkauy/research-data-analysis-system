## Objective

This project aims to investigate behavioral and lifestyle factors 
associated with student depression using structured exploratory 
data analysis and statistical reasoning.

The study focuses on identifying meaningful relationships between:

- Sleep duration
- Academic and work pressure
- Financial stress
- Lifestyle habits

and their potential contribution to depression risk.

The goal is to produce interpretable research insights rather than 
pure predictive modeling.

## Research Questions

1. Is sleep duration significantly associated with depression status?
2. Do academic or financial stress levels correlate with higher depression risk?
3. Which behavioral factors show the strongest statistical relationship with depression?

---

## EDA includes:

- Dataset integrity checks and column normalization
- Distribution analysis of demographic and behavioral variables
- Visualization of depression prevalence across factors
- Correlation analysis among numeric features

All visual outputs are saved for reproducible research reporting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Results

The following visualizations summarize key behavioral and lifestyle
patterns associated with student depression.

### Depression Distribution

This chart shows the prevalence of depression within the dataset,
providing a baseline understanding of class balance for further analysis.

---

### Age Distribution
![Age Distribution](artifacts/age_distribution.png)

The histogram illustrates the demographic age structure of the student
population, which may influence mental health risk patterns.

---

### Sleep Duration vs Depression
![Sleep vs Depression](artifacts/sleep_vs_depression.png)

This visualization explores whether reduced sleep duration is associated
with higher depression prevalence, a commonly reported psychological factor.

The heatmap highlights statistical relationships among numeric variables,
helping identify potential predictors and confounding factors related to depression.
