This project aims to investigate behavioral and lifestyle factors 
associated with student depression using structured exploratory 
data analysis and statistical reasoning.

The study focuses on identifying meaningful relationships between:

- Sleep duration
- Academic and work pressure
- Financial stress
- Lifestyle habits

and their potential contribution to depression risk.

The goal is to produce interpretable research insights rather than 
pure predictive modeling.

2. Do academic or financial stress levels correlate with higher depression risk?
3. Which behavioral factors show the strongest statistical relationship with depression?

## EDA includes:

- Dataset integrity checks and column normalization
- Distribution analysis of demographic and behavioral variables
- Visualization of depression prevalence across factors
- Correlation analysis among numeric features

All visual outputs are saved for reproducible research reporting.
